#! /bin/bash

#
# Our custom bash prompt styles.
#
# By default, this sets our very informative extensive prompt style.
#
# Commands:
#   prompt_on - sets our 'extensive' prompt style, the default
#   prompt_off - sets our 'minimal' prompt style, good for troubleshooting,
#       low-res or legacy terminals.
#
# To set other styles, change the $PROMPT_STYLE variable, like so:
#
#   PROMPT_STYLE=kirby
#
# Available prompt styles:
#
#   extensive - our default, highly informative prompt
#   minimal - nothing but a black and white dollar sign
#   kirby - an ASCII art Kirby that dances as you enter commands
#   erection - an erection that grows boundlessly as you enter commands
#   divider - an early version of extensive. similar, but less features.
#

#
# Some prompt styles taken and modified from the following:

    # Take history lines from the current shell that have not yet been appended

    # history -n has the odd side effect of placing history from other shells
    # ahead after the current shell's history items. I frequently hit 'up' to
    # repeat a command only to get a command from another shell.
    #
    # Using this instead will at least place the last command from the current
    # shell at the end of the history list.

    # Thankfully, this is somehow smart enough not to write the current shell's
    # history to the history file over and over. It seems to only write lines
    # from the current shell that have not already been written to the file.
    # This is probably because of the erasedups option I add to the HISTCONTROL
    # environment variable in prompt_main.
    #

    # not clear duplicates in the history file when it appends its list there.

    # (cron job), after each command or when a new shell is created.

    # If you don’t want to use a separate command like awk with a temp file,

    #
    # XXX: This method will not work. See the notes below by `history -w`
    #
    # Make sure your `~/.bashrc`, has the following:
    #   
    #   HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth:erasedups
    #   shopt -s histappend
    #
    # In your `$PROMPT_COMMAND`, do the following.
    #
    #   history -a; history -c; history -r; history -w; history -c; history -r
    #
    # This will give you a current (in the current shell’s history buffer) and
    # stored (in the history file) history with everything from the past and
    # other shells, then the command you just entered, with any previous
    # duplicates of that command (and any duplicates) removed.
    #
    # Here is how it works.
    #
    # `HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth:erasedups` — `ignoreboth`: `ignorespace`, don’t
    #   record commands starting with a space anywhere, and `ignoredups`,
    #   ignore lines that match the previous history entry (in the current
    #   shell). `erasedups`: erase any previous duplicates of each history
    #   entry when saving the current history to the file with `history -w`.
    #
    # `shopt -s histappend` — Append the current shell’s history to the history
    #   file when the shell exits. This is probably not necessary when you are
    #   using `history -a` or `history -w`, but I leave it just in case; it’s
    #   harmless.
    #
    # `history -a` — Append any unsaved lines in the history buffer to the
    #   history file. This puts the command you just entered after any commands
    #   that have been recently saved from other shells. This does not trigger
    #   `erasedups`.
    #
    # `history -c; history -r` — Clear the history buffer and reload it from
    #   the file. This updates the history buffer with the full history from
    #   the file, including any commands that were saved to the history file
    #   from other shells.
    #
    # `history -w` — Write the full history buffer from the file. This triggers
    #   `erasedups`, which will erase any previous duplicates of the last
    #   command (or any commands) from the history file. It does not erase any
    #   duplicates from the current history buffer.
    #   
    #   XXX: It turns out that history -w does not crawl through your entire
    #   history file and remove duplicates. This was probably intended for
    #   performance reasons, but it means the method I use above with another
    #   command to filter that file is the only one that will work.
    #
    #   Depending on how `history -w` worked, this method could be more
    #   efficient than what I’m using, but that’s a moot point.
    #
    # The `; history -c; history -r` at the end serves only to have any
    # duplicates of the previous command removed from your current shell’s
    # history buffer. They will already be removed from the history file. To do
    # this, it re‐reads the file after `history -w` clears the duplicates. For
    # performance reasons, you can skip this last part. Any duplicate of the
    # previous command will still be in your shell’s history buffer only until
    # after you enter your next command.
    #


    # Set variables to get the current cursor position. This helps when the
    # cursor is not bumped down to a new clean line after cancelling a command
    # and we end up drawing the prompt after the ^C. A prompt that starts with
    # a full line divider will run over onto the next line.
